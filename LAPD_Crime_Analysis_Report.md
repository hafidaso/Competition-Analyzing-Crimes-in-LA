# LAPD Crime Data Analysis (2020-2022)

Here's a summary and insights from the analysis of the LAPD crime dataset spanning 2020 to 2022:

## Temporal Trends:
- **Day of the Week**: Crimes were fairly consistent across days, with Friday seeing a slight increase.
- **Time of Day**: Late evenings and early nights (between 6 PM to 12 AM) were peak hours for crimes.
- **Monthly Variation**: Summer months, especially July, saw the highest crime rates, while winter months, particularly February, had the lowest.

## Crime Hotspots:
- **Central area** witnessed the highest number of crimes, followed by **Southwest** and **77th Street** areas.
- **Olympic** and **West Valley** saw fewer incidents compared to other regions.

## Victim Profile:
- **Age**: Individuals in the age group of 25-35 were most commonly targeted.
- **Descent**: Hispanic/Latin/Mexican descent witnessed the highest number of crimes, followed by White and Black descents.

## Weapon Analysis:
- **Handguns** and other firearms were predominant in violent crimes.
- **Knife/cutting instruments** were also frequently used in crimes like assaults.

## Crime Predictive Model:
Built a Random Forest model to predict the type of crime based on features like area, time of day, and day of the week. The model indicated that the hour of the day was the most influential feature, followed by the day of the week and area name.

## Crime Rates by Premise:
- **Streets** were the predominant locations for crimes, especially vehicle-related incidents.
- Residential areas, both **single-family dwellings** and **multi-unit dwellings**, saw high frequencies of identity thefts and intimate partner assaults.
- **Parking lots** were another hotspot for criminal activities.

## Insights:
- **Resource Allocation**: Given the peak crime hours and hotspot areas, the LAPD could reallocate resources to maximize efficiency.
- **Community Awareness**: Educating communities about prevalent crimes in their areas, such as identity thefts in residential zones, can help in prevention.
- **Focused Interventions**: Targeted interventions, like increased patrolling during late evenings in Central and Southwest areas, could reduce crime rates.
- **Victim Support**: Given the high number of intimate partner assaults, there's a need for robust victim support and intervention systems.
